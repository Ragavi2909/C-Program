*DOMAIN*   :C PROGRAMMING

*BATCH DURATION*:  December 30th, 2024 to January 30th, 2025



# TASK 1
*Description:*
 This program provides a practical demonstration of file operations in C Program. File handling is a fundamental concept in programming, enabling applications to store, retrieve, and manage persistent data.
 The program focuses on four key operations: creating, reading, writing, and appending data to a file.

# TASK 2
*Description:*
 This program implements a singly linked list, a dynamic data structure where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
 It supports three core operations: insertion (adding nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific position),
                                    deletion (removing nodes from any position),
                                    traversal from head to tail and tail to head

# TASK 3
*Description:*
This C program performs lexical analysis on a source file, identifying and categorizing keywords, operators, and identifiers. It reads the file, processes each character, and prints the corresponding lexical elements.

# TASK 4
*Description:*
This C program implements Run-Length Encoding (RLE) for compressing and decompressing text files, featuring a menu-driven interface for user interaction. It reads input files, performs RLE operations, and displays the processed file contents with error handling for file operations.
